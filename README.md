## Description

Ping Pong is a classic arcade game where two players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth. This web-based version of Ping Pong is built using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript.

## How to Play

- **Player 1 (Left Paddle):** Use the **Up Arrow** key to move the paddle up and the **Down Arrow** key to move the paddle down.
- **Player 2 (Right Paddle):** The right paddle is controlled by a simple AI that tries to follow the ball's movement.
- The goal is to bounce the ball past your opponent's paddle and score points.
- The game keeps track of your score and displays it at the top of the canvas.

## Installation

If you want to host the game on your own server or play it locally:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start the game.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the game settings by changing the values in the JavaScript code. You can adjust the paddle and ball speed, canvas size, or even add additional features to the game.
